# Code Quality

- Prefer pure functions; isolate side effects.
- No unused exports; keep modules focused (single responsibility).
- Avoid silent `catch`; log with context and surface user-safe errors.
- Discouraged use of `any` and implicit `any`.
- Keep files <300 lines and components <200 lines unless justified.
- Prefer composition over inheritance; avoid static singletons except for DI wrappers.
