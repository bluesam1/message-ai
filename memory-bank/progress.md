## Velocity Tracking

*Will track after implementation starts*

**Planned velocity:** 1 PRD per 2-3 hours  
**Actual velocity:** TBD

---

## Decision Log

### October 21, 2025

#### Project Setup (PRD 01)
- **Decision:** Use Context API for state management (not Zustand)
  - **Rationale:** Simpler for MVP scope, can migrate later if needed
  
- **Decision:** Foreground notifications only (skip background)
  - **Rationale:** Background notifications add complexity, foreground sufficient for 24-hour MVP
  
- **Decision:** Client-side notification sending (skip Cloud Functions)
  - **Rationale:** Cloud Functions add deployment complexity, client-side works for MVP
  
- **Decision:** Test mode for Firestore security rules initially
  - **Rationale:** Proper security rules take time, implement after core features work

#### Authentication (PRD 02)
- **Decision:** Use Firebase's default auth persistence (no AsyncStorage)
  - **Rationale:** Firebase Auth automatically handles session persistence on React Native, no additional dependencies needed
  
- **Decision:** Lock to React 19.1.0 exactly (not 19.2.0)
  - **Rationale:** React Native 0.81.4 requires React 19.1.0 precisely; 19.2.0 causes incompatibility errors
  
- **Decision:** Use Expo's package manager for all Expo packages
  - **Rationale:** `npx expo install` ensures SDK compatibility, prevents version mismatches
  
- **Decision:** Defer React Native Testing Library integration
  - **Rationale:** Testing libraries require React 19.2.0 which conflicts with RN 0.81.4; focus on Jest-based unit tests for now
  
- **Decision:** Always clear Metro cache after `.env` changes
  - **Rationale:** Metro doesn't automatically detect `.env` updates; `--clear` flag forces reload

## Notes for Future Sessions

### When Resuming Work
1. Read `activeContext.md` first for current state
2. Check this file for what's completed
3. Review current PRD being implemented
4. Check git status for uncommitted changes

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Check what's done
git log --oneline

# See current work
git status

# Run tests
npm test

# Check app still launches
npm start
```

---

**Next Update:** After PRD 01 completion (estimated 2 hours from start)
