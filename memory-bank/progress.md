### PRD 06.1: RTDB Presence Migration (100% Complete) ✅
**Timeline:** ~4 hours (expanded due to Cloud Functions and bug fixes)  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Completed:** October 22, 2025

#### Checklist
- [x] Firebase Realtime Database enabled and configured
- [x] RTDB security rules created (`database.rules.json`)
- [x] Firebase config updated (firebase.json, firebase.ts with databaseURL)
- [x] RTDB presence service implemented with .info/connected
- [x] onDisconnect() handlers for server-side offline detection
- [x] **Cloud Functions deployed for server-side Firestore mirroring** (replaced client-side approach)
- [x] AuthContext updated to use rtdbPresenceService with proper logout sequence
- [x] Old Firestore-only presence files removed
- [x] RTDB security rules deployed via Firebase CLI
- [x] Cloud Functions deployed to Firebase
- [x] Unit tests written for rtdbPresenceService (12 test scenarios)
- [x] Documentation updated (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md)
- [x] **Logout race condition fixed** (cleanup → setOffline → signOut ordering)
- [x] **Header logout button fixed** (now uses AuthContext.signOut)
- [x] **Timestamp consistency fixed** (Firestore server timestamps)
- [x] **Global timer optimization** (useCurrentTime hook for all presence indicators)

**Key Implementations:**
- rtdbPresenceService with connection monitoring, onDisconnect handlers, and explicit setOffline method
- **Cloud Function `onPresenceChange`** for server-side RTDB → Firestore mirroring
- Instance-specific Cloud Function: `.instance('msg-ai-1-default-rtdb')`
- usePresence hook updated to handle Firestore Timestamp objects (.toMillis())
- **useCurrentTime hook** - Global 60-second timer shared across all PresenceIndicator components
- Comprehensive unit tests with mocked Firebase functions
- Updated Memory Bank documentation with RTDB presence pattern

**Problem Solved:**
- Original Firestore-only presence showed all users as "online" all the time
- App state listeners don't detect crashes, force-quits, or sudden disconnects
- RTDB's `.info/connected` and `onDisconnect()` provide reliable disconnect detection
- **Logout race condition** - connection listener was overwriting explicit offline status
- **Header logout bypass** - logout button was not calling presence cleanup
- **"Invalid Date" display** - inconsistent timestamp handling between RTDB and Firestore
- **Static "Last seen" text** - relative time not updating as time passed

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Integrated RTDB alongside existing Firestore without breaking UI
- **Upgraded to Cloud Functions** for production reliability (client-side mirroring insufficient)
- Fixed complex logout sequence with proper ordering (cleanup → setOffline → signOut)
- Granted necessary Firebase service account permissions (Artifact Registry, Editor roles)
- Explicitly specified RTDB instance name in Cloud Function
- Achieved consistent Firestore timestamps using server-side timestamps
- Optimized timer performance with single global interval for all components
- Updated all imports and removed old presence service cleanly

**Documentation Created:**
- _docs/CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md - Deployment instructions
- _docs/EMULATOR_TESTING.md - Local testing guide
- _docs/RTDB_INSTANCE_FIX.md - Instance name requirement
- _docs/LOGOUT_PRESENCE_FIX.md - Race condition details
- _docs/PRD_06.1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md - Final summary

## Velocity Tracking

*Will track after implementation starts*

**Planned velocity:** 1 PRD per 2-3 hours  
**Actual velocity:** TBD

---

## Decision Log

### October 21, 2025

#### Project Setup (PRD 01)
- **Decision:** Use Context API for state management (not Zustand)
  - **Rationale:** Simpler for MVP scope, can migrate later if needed
  
- **Decision:** Foreground notifications only (skip background)
  - **Rationale:** Background notifications add complexity, foreground sufficient for 24-hour MVP
  
- **Decision:** Client-side notification sending (skip Cloud Functions)
  - **Rationale:** Cloud Functions add deployment complexity, client-side works for MVP
  
- **Decision:** Test mode for Firestore security rules initially
  - **Rationale:** Proper security rules take time, implement after core features work

#### Authentication (PRD 02)
- **Decision:** Use Firebase's default auth persistence (no AsyncStorage)
  - **Rationale:** Firebase Auth automatically handles session persistence on React Native, no additional dependencies needed
  
- **Decision:** Lock to React 19.1.0 exactly (not 19.2.0)
  - **Rationale:** React Native 0.81.4 requires React 19.1.0 precisely; 19.2.0 causes incompatibility errors
  
- **Decision:** Use Expo's package manager for all Expo packages
  - **Rationale:** `npx expo install` ensures SDK compatibility, prevents version mismatches
  
- **Decision:** Defer React Native Testing Library integration
  - **Rationale:** Testing libraries require React 19.2.0 which conflicts with RN 0.81.4; focus on Jest-based unit tests for now
  
- **Decision:** Always clear Metro cache after `.env` changes
  - **Rationale:** Metro doesn't automatically detect `.env` updates; `--clear` flag forces reload

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

### When Resuming Work
1. Read `activeContext.md` first for current state
2. Check this file for what's completed
3. Review current PRD being implemented
4. Check git status for uncommitted changes

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Check what's done
git log --oneline

# See current work
git status

# Run tests
npm test

# Check app still launches
npm start
```
