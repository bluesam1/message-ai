  // Note: Full Firestore service tests would require mocking Firestore SDK
  // This adds significant complexity. For MVP, we're focusing on:
  // 1. Utility function tests (validation, error messages) - High value, low complexity
  // 2. Manual testing of Firebase integration - Ensures real-world functionality
  //
  // Future improvements:
  // - Add firebase-mock or similar library
  // - Test createUserProfile, getUserProfile, etc. with mocked Firestore
  // - Test error handling in service functions
