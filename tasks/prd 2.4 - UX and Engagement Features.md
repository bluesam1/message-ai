- User taps emoji to add reaction
- Reactions display below message bubble with count
- User can tap existing reaction to see who reacted
- User can remove their own reaction by tapping again
- Reactions sync in real-time across all participants

**Technical Requirements**

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Model Changes

### Firestore Schema Extensions

**messages collection:**
Add `reactions` array:

```typescript
reactions: Array<{
  userId: string,
  emoji: string,        // 'üëç', '‚ù§Ô∏è', 'üòÇ', 'üòÆ', 'üò¢', 'üôè'
  timestamp: number
}>
```

No other schema changes needed for theme polish.

## üë§ User Stories

**Reactions:**
- **US-045:** As a user, I can long-press a message and select a reaction emoji to express my response quickly.
- **US-046:** As a user, I can see how many people reacted with each emoji below the message.
- **US-047:** As a user, I can tap a reaction to see who reacted with that emoji.
- **US-048:** As a user, I can remove my reaction by tapping the same emoji again.
- **US-049:** As a user, I want reactions to appear in real-time when others react to messages.

**Visual Polish:**
- **US-050:** As a user, I want the app to feel modern and polished with consistent visual design.
- **US-051:** As a user, I expect smooth animations when messages appear and actions occur.
- **US-052:** As a user, I want clear loading indicators so I know when the app is processing.
