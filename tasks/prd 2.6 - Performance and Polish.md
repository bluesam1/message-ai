- Track token usage per operation
- Set up cost monitoring and alerts
- Document token usage in technical docs

### Firestore Read Optimization
- Review all Firestore queries, ensure indexes exist
- Implement local cache for frequently accessed data
- Use Firestore offline persistence
- Minimize real-time listeners (unsubscribe when not needed)
- Batch reads where possible

### Image Optimization
- Ensure image compression is working (check file sizes)
- Implement lazy loading for images in chat
- Use appropriate image sizes (don't load full-res for thumbnails)
- Cache images locally (SQLite or file system)
- Placeholder while loading (blur or dominant color)

### Memory Optimization
- Profile for memory leaks (Flipper or Chrome DevTools)
- Ensure listeners are cleaned up (useEffect cleanup)
- Avoid storing large objects in state unnecessarily
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize FlatList (removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch)

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Lazy load non-critical screens
- Split large bundles if needed
- Defer loading of heavy libraries (only load when needed)

- Document device specs (model, OS version)
- Note network conditions during testing

### Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks
- Use React DevTools to identify unnecessary re-renders
- Use Flipper to profile network requests and memory usage
- Identify slowest operations (> target time)
- Prioritize optimization by impact (critical path first)

### Step 3: Optimize
- Implement optimizations for identified bottlenecks
- Re-run benchmarks after each optimization
- Verify performance improvement
- Document changes and results

### Step 4: Validate
- Run full benchmark suite again
- Ensure all metrics meet targets
- Regression test (ensure optimizations didn't break anything)
