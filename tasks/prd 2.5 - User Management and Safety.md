# PRD 2.5: User Management & Safety

**Phase:** 2 - International Communicator  
**Sub-Phase:** 2.5  
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete (core messaging working)

---

## üéØ Objective

Give users control over their conversations and interactions through features for leaving/deleting chats, blocking users, and managing conversation preferences. Enhance safety and user autonomy while maintaining data integrity.

## üìã Scope

### Leaving & Deleting Chats

**Group Chats: Leave**
- User can leave a group chat they're part of
- System removes user from participants list
- System message notifies remaining members: "[User] left the chat"
- User can no longer send or receive messages in that group
- If last participant leaves, conversation is deleted entirely

**Direct Chats: Delete**
- User can delete a one-on-one conversation
- Conversation marked as hidden for that user (soft delete)
- Other participant still sees conversation
- When both users delete, conversation can be archived or purged

**Technical Requirements**
- Add "Leave Chat" option to group conversation long-press menu
- Add "Delete Chat" option to direct conversation long-press menu
- Confirmation dialog with clear explanation of action
- Update Firestore conversation document (remove from participants or add to hiddenFor)

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Model Changes

### Firestore Schema Extensions

**users collection:**
Add blocking and preference fields:

```typescript
blockedUsers: string[],        // Array of blocked user IDs
mutedConversations: string[]   // Array of muted conversation IDs
```

**conversations collection:**
Add visibility and archive fields:

```typescript
hiddenFor: string[],          // User IDs who deleted this chat
archivedBy: string[]          // User IDs who archived this chat
```

**messages collection:**
Add soft delete flag:

```typescript
isDeleted: boolean            // Soft delete flag (preserve for sync integrity)
```

- **US-056:** As a user, I can delete a one-on-one conversation from my view.
- **US-057:** As a user, I expect deleted conversations to remain for the other person until they also delete.

**Blocking:**
- **US-058:** As a user, I can block another user to prevent them from contacting me.
- **US-059:** As a user, I want blocked users' messages to be hidden from my view.
- **US-060:** As a user, I want my online status hidden from blocked users.
- **US-061:** As a user, I can view my list of blocked users and unblock them if needed.

**Archive & Mute:**

---

## üîê Security & Privacy Considerations

**Firestore Security Rules:**
- Users can only add themselves to `hiddenFor` or `archivedBy`
- Users can only remove themselves from `participants`
- Users can only update their own `blockedUsers` array
- Blocked users cannot write to conversations with blocking user
- System messages for leaving are write-protected

**Privacy:**
- Blocked users do not know they've been blocked (no notification)
- Deleted conversations remain private (other user cannot see deletion status)
- User data (blockedUsers, archivedBy) not exposed to other users

**Data Retention:**
- Soft delete strategy preserves data integrity
- Hard deletion only when all participants delete conversation
- Blocked user data retained in case of unblock

---

## üìù Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Update README with user management features
- [ ] Document blocking system and privacy implications
- [ ] Create user guide for leaving groups and blocking users
- [ ] Document Firestore schema changes (blockedUsers, hiddenFor, etc.)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common scenarios

---

## üé¨ Demo Requirements

For sub-phase completion, demonstrate:

1. **Leave Group:** Leave a group chat, show system message for others
2. **Delete Conversation:** Delete direct chat, verify hidden but persists for other user
3. **Block User:** Block a user, show conversations hidden and online status hidden
4. **Unblock User:** Unblock from settings, show conversations reappear
5. **Archive:** Archive conversation, show it moves to archive folder
6. **Mute:** Mute conversation, send message, verify no notification
