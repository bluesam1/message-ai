# PRD 2.1: Foundation & Simple AI Features

**Phase:** 2 - International Communicator  
**Sub-Phase:** 2.1  
**Duration:** 6-8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete (all core messaging features working)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Establish AI infrastructure with Cloud Functions and OpenAI integration, then deliver three immediately useful AI features that help users understand messages across languages and cultures.

---

## 📋 Scope

### Infrastructure Setup

**Cloud Functions Foundation**
- Set up Firebase Cloud Functions project structure
- Integrate OpenAI API with secure key management
- Create base endpoint for AI operations (`/translateMessage`)
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Deploy and verify Cloud Functions work on Firebase

**Configuration**
- Store OpenAI API key securely in Firebase environment config
- Configure OpenAI settings:
  - Model: `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4-turbo`
  - Temperature: `0.3`
  - Token limit: `500` tokens max per request
- Set up cost monitoring and usage tracking

### Feature 1: Inline Translation

**User Experience**
- User long-presses a message to see action menu
- Selects "Translate" option
- Loading spinner appears while translating
- Translated text displays inline below original message
- User can tap to toggle between original and translation
- Translation is cached for instant subsequent views

**Technical Requirements**
- Add "Translate" option to message long-press menu
- Call Cloud Function with message text and target language
- Display loading state during API call
- Cache translation result in Firestore message metadata
- Implement toggle UI (tap to switch original/translation)
- Handle errors gracefully (show original message if translation fails)

### Feature 2: Cultural Context Hint

**User Experience**
- User taps "Explain" button on message toolbar
- Modal or expandable section shows cultural/contextual explanation
- Explanation helps user understand cultural nuances, idioms, or references
- Result is cached to avoid redundant API calls

**Technical Requirements**
- Add "Explain" button to message toolbar
- Call Cloud Function requesting cultural context explanation
- Display explanation in accessible format (modal or inline)
- Cache explanation in Firestore
- Provide clear, concise explanations (100-150 words max)

### Feature 3: Slang/Idiom Explanation

**User Experience**
- User taps "What does this mean?" button on message toolbar
- System provides simple definition/explanation of unfamiliar terms
- Result displays inline or in tooltip
- Cached for future reference

**Technical Requirements**
- Add "Define" button to message toolbar
- Call Cloud Function for slang/idiom definition
- Display definition clearly and concisely
- Cache result in Firestore
- Handle unknown terms gracefully ("Unable to explain this phrase")

## 🗄️ Data Model Changes

### Firestore Schema Extension

**messages collection:**
Add `aiMeta` field to store AI-generated content:

```typescript
aiMeta: {
  detectedLang?: string,
  translatedText?: { [lang: string]: string },
  explanation?: string,
  slangDefinition?: string
}
```

---

## 👤 User Stories

**US-024:** As a user, I can long-press a message and select "Translate" to read it in my preferred language.

**US-025:** As a user, I want translations to appear quickly (< 3 seconds) so I can maintain conversation flow.

**US-026:** As a user, I can tap a translated message to view the original text and verify accuracy.

**US-027:** As a user, I can request a cultural explanation for messages I don't fully understand.

**US-028:** As a user, I can get definitions of slang terms or idioms I'm unfamiliar with.

**US-029:** As a user, I want explanations and translations to be cached so they load instantly when I revisit.

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Cloud Functions deployed and accessible from app
- [ ] OpenAI API integration working with proper authentication
- [ ] All 3 AI features (translate, explain, define) functional
- [ ] Translations appear in < 3 seconds (95th percentile)
- [ ] Results are cached in Firestore for instant reloads
- [ ] Error handling shows original message if AI call fails
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API abuse

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Maximum |
|--------|--------|---------|
| AI Response Time | < 2s | 3s |
| Cache Reload Time | < 100ms | 200ms |
| Cloud Function Cold Start | < 3s | 5s |

### Quality Requirements
- Translation accuracy validated with 10+ test messages in 5+ languages
- Cultural explanations are relevant and helpful (manual validation)
- Error states tested (network failures, API timeouts, invalid input)
- Cost monitoring shows token usage per request

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope

- Automatic translation (covered in Sub-Phase 2.2)
- User preferences for target language (covered in Sub-Phase 2.2)
- Smart replies or composition assistance (covered in Sub-Phase 2.3)
- Message reactions or UI polish (covered in Sub-Phase 2.4)

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test translation with messages in 5+ languages
- [ ] Verify cultural explanations are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Test slang definitions with common expressions
- [ ] Verify cache works (reload message, translation appears instantly)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network offline, API quota exceeded)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify Cloud Functions deploy successfully
- [ ] Test OpenAI API connection and authentication
- [ ] Verify Firestore writes for cached results
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior

### Cost Validation
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI token usage per request
- [ ] Verify caching reduces redundant API calls
- [ ] Confirm cost per message is acceptable (< $0.01 per translation)

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Pre-Implementation Baseline
- Current state: No AI features
- Baseline: All AI operations should not impact existing message send/receive performance

### Post-Implementation Targets
- AI response time: < 3s (average), < 5s (max)
- Cache hit rate: > 80% for repeated translations
- Cloud Function success rate: > 99%
- Zero performance impact on non-AI message operations

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- OpenAI API key stored in Firebase environment config (never in code)
- Rate limiting per user to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent prompt injection attacks
- No sensitive user data sent to OpenAI (only message text)
- Firestore security rules restrict write access to message owners

---

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Update README with AI features overview
- [ ] Document Cloud Functions setup process
- [ ] Create guide for adding OpenAI API key to Firebase config
- [ ] Document Firestore schema changes (aiMeta field)
- [ ] Add code comments explaining AI integration patterns

---

## 🎬 Demo Requirements

For sub-phase completion, demonstrate:
1. Translating a message from another language to English
2. Requesting a cultural explanation for an idiom
3. Defining a slang term
4. Showing cached results load instantly
5. Handling a translation error gracefully
