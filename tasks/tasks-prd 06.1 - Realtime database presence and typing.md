# Task List: PRD 06.1 - Realtime Database Presence (RTDB Migration)

Based on: `tasks/prd 06.1 - Realtime database presence and typing`

---

## Relevant Files

### Configuration
- `src/config/firebase.ts` - Add Firebase Realtime Database initialization
- `database.rules.json` - NEW: RTDB security rules for presence status
- `firebase.json` - Update to include database rules deployment
- `.env` - Verify RTDB URL is present (auto-generated with Firebase config)

### Services
- `src/services/user/rtdbPresenceService.ts` - NEW: RTDB-based presence with .info/connected and onDisconnect
- `__tests__/services/rtdbPresenceService.test.ts` - NEW: Unit tests for RTDB presence service
- `src/services/user/presenceService.ts` - REMOVE: Old Firestore-only presence (will be replaced)

### Hooks
- `src/hooks/usePresence.ts` - Keep unchanged (still reads from Firestore for UI compatibility)
- `src/hooks/usePresenceUpdates.ts` - REMOVE: No longer needed (RTDB handles app state automatically)

### Context
- `src/store/AuthContext.tsx` - Update to call rtdbPresenceService.initialize() on login

### Documentation
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Document RTDB presence pattern
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Add RTDB to technology stack
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Update current status to reflect RTDB migration
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Update PRD 06.1 completion status

### Notes

- Firebase Realtime Database uses same Firebase config as Firestore (no additional environment variables needed)
- RTDB free tier: 1GB storage, 10GB/month download - plenty for MVP
- RTDB URL is auto-generated: `https://<project-id>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/`
- Unit tests will mock RTDB `ref()`, `onValue()`, `set()`, `onDisconnect()` methods
- Existing UI components need NO changes - they read from Firestore which RTDB mirrors to

## Success Criteria

When all tasks are complete:

✅ Firebase Realtime Database enabled and configured  
✅ RTDB security rules deployed  
✅ RTDB presence service implemented with `.info/connected` and `onDisconnect()`  
✅ Client-side Firestore mirroring working (no Cloud Functions)  
✅ Old Firestore-only presence service removed  
✅ AuthContext calls RTDB service on login/logout  
✅ Manual tests confirm:
  - Users show online when app is active
  - Users show offline within 1s of force-quit/crash
  - Reconnection restores online status automatically
  - Multiple devices see same presence status
✅ Unit tests pass for RTDB presence service  
✅ Documentation updated in Memory Bank  
✅ No UI changes needed (components still read from Firestore)

---

## Notes

- **DO NOT start sub-tasks automatically** - Wait for user permission before proceeding to next task
- Mark each sub-task `[x]` as completed
- Mark parent task `[x]` when ALL sub-tasks are complete
- Update this file after completing each significant piece of work
- Firebase Realtime Database is already included in the `firebase` npm package - no additional installation needed
- RTDB and Firestore can coexist - they serve different purposes (RTDB for presence, Firestore for everything else)
